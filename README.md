 <li>There are a number of small, mostly trivial, assignments (though the description is long).</li>

 <li>Precise submission details are given in Section 3.</li>

 <li>2 Assignments</li>

 <li>You need to have a CIMS computer account. If you do not have one yet please follow <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/userservices/accounts/obtain">https://cims.nyu</a><a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/userservices/accounts/obtain"><sub>. </sub></a>56 <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/userservices/accounts/obtain">edu/webapps/content/systems/userservices/accounts/obtain</a> to request an account. Your request 57 should generally be automatically granted.</li>

</ul>

58 2. Read the syllabus for the class, 2433<sub>.pdf</sub>. Decide whether you fully understand it. If you do not, state what 59 needs to be clarified for full understanding.

<ul>

 <li>Please read the file University01.pdf and follow the instructions in it.</li>

 <li>As part of this assignment you will make sure that you are able to produce an ER diagram and an associated 62 text file when required. In this assignment,</li>

</ul>

63                  • Reproduce the diagram ER01.pdf (it may be difficult to see, but note that the line under C is dotted) 64        and modify the file text01.txt, both of which are part of this archive.

<ul>

 <li>The diagram has the following shapes</li>

 <li>rectangles (use the not-rounded version)</li>

 <li>diamonds (rhombuses)</li>

 <li>rectangles with diamonds inside</li>

 <li>ellipses</li>

 <li>triangles</li>

 <li>The diagram has the following types (formats) of lines</li>

 <li>regular</li>

 <li>double</li>

 <li>dashed</li>

 <li>with and without arrows</li>

 <li>The diagram has the following types (formats) of text</li>

 <li>regular</li>

 <li>underlined</li>

 <li>underlined by dots</li>

 <li>To produce your diagram, use draw.io <a href="https://www.draw.io/">https://www.draw.io/</a><a href="https://www.draw.io/">,</a> which is free and does not require any</li>

 <li>installation, but installation can generally be done, so you can work locally, if you like. Use the Basic set of 82 templates and in it use the Entity Relation template; if it does not have what you need to complete the 83    diagram, use also the General template. Try to fit it on one page. The <em>native format </em>you will use is drawio.</li>

</ul>

84 Start with the given ER01.drawio. Your drawing diagram should be a duplicate of the one in this assignment 85 but put your own NetID in the cloud drawn there.

86 Don’t be fanatical about the faithfulness of the duplication. It is enough to make sure that the various shapes 87 are the same as the ones given and placed roughly in the same locations, that the lines are recognizable as 88 the ones given, that the shapes are connected as in the diagram (note particularly that sometime connections 89 are to vertexes and sometime to edges so reproduce that), and that the text in the shapes is formatted as 90 given. But do try to be neat.

91                                      If the system does not allow you to upload ER01.drawio, state so in Item 1d of Section 3.
